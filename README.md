"godot 4.1.1 project"  

The Queefs Branch

The "Black cat" fodler should be placed directly in the res:// dierctory or else you'll get filepath errors. 
Spooky Booth is under assets and goes in there in godot because consistency is fading memory

Last commit added audio to the animation via input but jump is still bugged to hell. Maybe audio sample length issue? Other audio takes a second or so to start playing too
